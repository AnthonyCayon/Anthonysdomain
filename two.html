                    <h2>TAP-IN WITH THE PROJECT</h2>
                    <p>One powerful way to change your perspective on any project is to embrace the beginner's mindset. Approach your task as if you’re learning about it for the first time, with a fresh set of eyes. Set aside your expertise and previous experiences, and open yourself up to new possibilities and ideas. </p> 
                    <p>Start by asking basic questions about the project, just like a newbie would. Why is this project important? What are its core objectives? What assumptions have we made? By doing this, you can uncover fresh insights and innovative solutions that might be overlooked by an experienced mind. Experiment with techniques or methods you’ve never tried before, even if they seem unconventional. Seek feedback from those who are less familiar with the project—they might spot something you’ve missed. This mindset can spark creativity and lead to breakthroughs that push your project to new heights.</p>

                    <h2>SCRAP IT AND SHIFT GEARS</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes, the best way to change your perspective on a project is to start completely from scratch. When you’ve been stuck in the same routine or hitting the same roadblocks, scrapping your current approach and beginning anew can bring a surge of fresh ideas and clarity. Clear your workspace, put away the old drafts, and approach the project with a clean slate. Forget about what you’ve done before and focus on what you want to achieve now.</p>
                    <p> This reset allows you to reconsider the project’s goals, rethink your strategies, and explore different angles that you hadn’t considered. It’s like hitting the reset button for your creativity. With everything out of the way, you can see the project with a new perspective, making it easier to spot opportunities and solutions that were previously hidden. Don’t be afraid to let go of the old to make room for new possibilities.</p>
